# Townsim

This game is aimed to be a huge world simulator game. 
It's my first JS development so some code may be a little bit crappy, but I don't intend to replace it until I have a working game.

# Philosophy
The game philosophy is quite simple, simulate a reality where people born, evolve and die. No more, no less (and no user input.)

# HOW
I don't know yet :D. I'm working in various projects in order to get knowledge about emulating worlds so I can find an answer to this question.

# WHO

Right now, only myself. (Hoijof)
